# Power BI Data Encryption Vigenere Square


The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text using substitution. It works by using a cipher (a keyword or passphrase) to shift the letters of the plaintext.

Encryption Process:
Write the Plaintext (the word to encrypt) and Cipher (the keyword) beneath each other, repeating the cipher as necessary.

Example:
Plaintext: "Hello World"
Cipher: "AETHE RAETH"
Align the Cipher with the Plaintext:



Plaintext: H  E  L  L  O     W  O  R  L  D
Cipher:    A  E  T  H  E     R  A  E  T  H


Use a Vigenère Square: The Vigenère square is a table where each row is a shifted alphabet (A-Z). The cipher letter determines which row to use, and the plaintext letter determines which column to use for encryption.
