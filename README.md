# Power BI Data Encryption Vigenere Square


Vigenere square is used to perform data encryption against a cipher

In this instance - a parameter is set with the cipher to then compare against the word to be encrypted 

Using a shifted alphabet table the word and cipher are joined to pull an encrypted letter

This is done by using the word and then matching against a repeated cipher
